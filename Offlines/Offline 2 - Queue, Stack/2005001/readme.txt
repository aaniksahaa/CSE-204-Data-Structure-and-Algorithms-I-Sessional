There are six source files in total. Here is a brief overview of each of the files.

1. MyQueueArr.cpp 

This file contains the array based implementation of queue. It consists of 
a template class named MyQueue which has two constructors (as per instructions), one destructor, 
other public functions and one function for printing the queue as needed. This file does not
contain any main function.

2. MyQueueLL.cpp 

This file contains the linked-list based implementation of queue.
It consists of a template class named MyQueue which has two constructors (as per instructions), one 
destructor, other public functions and one function for printing the queue as needed. This file 
does not contain any main function. 

3. MyStackArr.cpp 

This file contains the array based implementation of stack. It consists of 
a template class named MyStack which has two constructors (as per instructions), one destructor, 
other public functions and one function for printing the stack as needed. This file does not
contain any main function.

4. MyStackLL.cpp 

This file contains the linked-list based implementation of stack.
It consists of a template class named MyStack which has two constructors (as per instructions), one 
destructor, other public functions and one function for printing the queue as needed. This file 
does not contain any main function. 

5. Node.cpp

This file contains a generic class named Node which is necessary for linked-list based implementations.

6. queue-stack_main.cpp

This file contains a main function for demostrating the implementations. There are four lines on top
of this file which include the previous two files. When one pair of them is uncommented and other pair is commented
those specific implementation can be tested. All input/output are based on File I/O

7. fifasim.cpp

This file contains the solution to the simulation problem. 
This uses the previous implemenatations.
All I/O in main function are based on File I/O.
